# Over-Engineered CRUD

Welcome to the **Over-Engineered CRUD** project! This repository contains a robust and modular implementation of a CRUD system built with a focus on scalability, maintainability, and best practices in software development. The project leverages TypeScript, Express, TypeORM, Zod, and other modern tools.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Basic user registration with validation and password hashing.
- **Modularity**: Clear separation of concerns across different layers (domain, application, presentation, infra).
- **Validation**: Powered by Zod to ensure robust input validation.
- **Database Management**: Uses SQLite with TypeORM for ORM capabilities.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for a seamless user experience.
- **Code Quality**: Pre-configured ESLint and Prettier for consistent code styling and formatting.

## Technologies

- **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- **Framework**: [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
- **ORM**: [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/)
- **Validation**: [Zod](https://zod.dev/)
- **Testing**: [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)
- **Cryptography**: [Bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt)

â”œâ”€â”€ application/        # Application-level use cases and mocks
â”œâ”€â”€ domain/             # Domain entities, contracts, and business logic
â”œâ”€â”€ infra/              # Infrastructure implementations (database, validators, cryptography)

|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `npm run start`   | Starts the application.                               |
| `npm run dev`     | Starts the app in development mode with hot reload.   |
| `npm run clean`   | Cleans the `dist` directory.                          |
| `npm run build`   | Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript.                    |
| `npm run test`    | Runs tests using Vitest.                              |
| `npm run lint`    | Runs ESLint to check for coding standard violations.  |
| `npm run format`  | Formats code using Prettier.                          |

## Usage

### Starting the Application

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will start on [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333).

### API Endpoints

#### Register a User

- **POST** `/auth/register`
- **Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "username": "johndoe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "password": "password123",
    "passwordConfirmation": "password123"
  }
  ```
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "id": "uuid",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "username": "johndoe",
    "email": "john@example.com"
  }
  ```

## Testing

Run the unit tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

### Key Testing Tools:
- **Vitest**: For unit and integration testing.
- **Faker.js**: For generating mock data in tests.
